Defined in:

Overview
--------

The streams channel delivers all the turbo-stream actions created (primarily) through `Turbo::Broadcastable`. A subscription to this channel is made for each individual stream that one wishes to listen for updates to. The subscription relies on being passed a `signed_stream_name` parameter generated by turning a set of streamables into signed stream name using `Turbo::Streams::StreamName#signed_stream_name`. This is automatically done using the view helper `Turbo::StreamsHelper#turbo_stream_from(*streamables)`. If the signed stream name cannot be verified, the subscription is rejected.

In case if custom behavior is desired, one can create their own channel and re-use some of the primitives from helper modules like `Turbo::Streams::StreamName`:

```
 class CustomChannel < ActionCable::Channel::Base
    extend Turbo::Streams::Broadcasts, Turbo::Streams::StreamName
    include Turbo::Streams::StreamName::ClassMethods

    def subscribed
      if (stream_name = verified_stream_name_from_params).present? &&
         subscription_allowed?
        stream_from stream_name
      else
        reject
      end
    end

    def subscription_allowed?
       # ...
    end
 end

This channel can be connected to a web page using <tt>:channel</tt> option in
<tt>turbo_stream_from</tt> helper:

  <%= turbo_stream_from 'room', channel: CustomChannel %>
```
