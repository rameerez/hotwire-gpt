=============================================================

Current version: [1.0.0-beta1](https://github.com/hotwired/strada-web/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta1) --- released Sep 19, 2023

**Strada** enables you to create fully native controls in your hybrid mobile apps, driven by the web. Build web components and native components that work together in *WebView* screens to elevate your [Turbo Native](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/handbook/native) apps to the next level.

-   [Strada Web](https://strada.hotwired.dev/handbook/web) enables you to use your existing HTML to create web components that send and respond to messages with components in your native apps.
-   [Strada iOS](https://strada.hotwired.dev/handbook/ios) and [Strada Android](https://strada.hotwired.dev/handbook/android) enable you to create native components that receive and reply to messages from web components that are present on the page. All without writing any JavaScript in your native apps.

Strada components leverage [Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev) and work seamlessly with [Turbo](https://turbo.hotwired.dev) web and [Turbo Native](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/handbook/native) apps.
