# Strada Web

Strada is a JavaScript library that makes it easy to create web components in your application using your existing HTML. See [how it works](/handbook/how-it-works) and the [installation instructions](/handbook/installing).

<div class="landing-actions">
  <a class="landing-actions__item" href="https://github.com/hotwired/strada-web">
    <div class="landing-actions__icon landing-actions__icon--github" aria-hidden="true"></div>
    hotwired/strada-web
  </a>
</div>

<br/>

If you'd like to see Strada in action with examples, you can run the [Turbo iOS demo app](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-ios/tree/main/Demo) or the [Turbo Android demo app](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-android/tree/main/demo). They work together with the [Turbo Native demo web app](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-native-demo), where you can see the source code for the demo web components.
